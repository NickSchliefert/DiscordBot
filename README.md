# DiscordBot

## Project Flavour Text

This project involved the creation of a custom Discord bot, called "Cash! the Crypto Companion".

The main purpose of the bot is to allow users to stay up to date with the latest price action for cryptocurrencies. They can also be shown a random crypto project from the top 250 (by market cap).

The main commands are:

cash! price - Get the current price data of a coin, including % changes, 24 hour trading volume, market cap rank, and more.
cash! random - Get a random coin from the top 250 to explore!
cash! global - Get the current global cryptocurrency market data, including the total market cap, BTC/ETH dominance, and more.

Cash! the Crypto Companion is Powered by CoinGecko API.

## Project Aim
I initially began this project as an adventure into the world that is Discord bots. I had always wanted to try my hand at creating one, as the possibilities on Discord seem endless, with all the creative bots and servers that I had seen.

In order to learn how to begin building a Discord bot, I watched YouTube tutorials for general Discord bot creation, as well as also studying and experimenting with the Discord.JS framework.

Given my interest in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, I felt that the idea of "price checker" was a reasonable first project.

## Technology
This Discord bot was programmed in JavaScript using a number of different libraries and APIs, including:
- https://discord.js.org/#/
- https://github.com/miscavage/CoinGecko-API

The project is currently being hosted on an Ubuntu cloud compute service using https://www.vultr.com/. Prior to this, I would run and test the project locally using Node in the terminal, and a private discord server.

## Try out the bot yourself!
